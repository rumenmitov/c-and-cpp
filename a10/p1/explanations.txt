a)
    I get 'not-in-scope' errors, because classes like 'string' are not
    declared in the scope and without 'namespace std' the compiler
    does not know that we want to use 'std::string' for example.

    An alternate way to fix this issue is to prefix standard 
    objects with 'std::'.

b) 

    Removed 'Critter::' from the method 'setName'. I get the error 'name' not
    not in scope. This is because the compiler does not know that we want to
    use 'name' from the 'Critter' class.

    You cannot fix the issue by prefixing 'name' with 'Critter' because
    the property 'name' is private and it can only be accessed through class
    methods.
